# 🐍 Python Project Template for UV

This repository provides a [**Cookiecutter**](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template designed for creating consistent and modern Python project structures. It is tailored to projects using the [**Astral**](https://astral.sh/) tooling ecosystem, namely:

- [**uv**](https://astral.sh/blog/introducing-uv/) – a fast Python package manager and workflow tool
- [**ruff**](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) – an extremely fast Python linter and formatter
- Future integration planned with [**ty**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty).

## 📦 Dependencies

Before using the template, make sure you have the following installed:

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version **3.10 or higher**
- [**Cookiecutter**](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

# Getting Started

## Installing the Template

To use this template, generate a new project by invoking [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with the template’s GitHub URL.

### Standard Installation

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/arnaudguibbert/python-template.git
```

You’ll be prompted to enter several configuration options such as project_name, project_dir, and others. For a complete list of inputs, refer to the [Template inputs](#template-inputs) section.

### Installing a Specific Version

To use a tagged release version of the template:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/arnaudguibbert/python-template.git --checkout v0.1.0
```

## Working with the Template

### Project Structure

If you're unfamiliar with the standard Python project layout or are using this template for the first time, we recommend reading the [Structure Documentation](./docs/structure.md). It provides a detailed explanation of each file generated by the template and how to use them effectively.

### Makefile Commands

The template includes a `Makefile` with several predefined commands that streamline common development workflows, including:

- Linting code with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
- Running test suites
- Installing dependencies using [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/introducing-uv/)

Consult the generated `Makefile` in your project for the full list of available commands and usage examples.

### Common Operations

<!-- After generating your project, you’ll commonly perform operations such as:

- Running tests using your preferred test runner
- Formatting and linting source code with Ruff
- Installing dependencies using `uv pip install`
- Updating metadata and configuration in `pyproject.toml` -->
